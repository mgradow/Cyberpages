                <h1>What even is Cybersecurity?</h1>
                <p>Cybersecurity is as the name says but there's much more inside of it. Just like a lock on a door, it's about what's inside that needs protected in all shapes and forms. It protects important imformation such as passwords, classified information, and it's what every agency in the modern world uses today. As we all know, the whole world is linked to a cloud.</p>

                <h1>What security did we use in the past?</h1>
                <p>Before computers, we had physical locks and everything was stored on physical documents. Part of this was very prevalent during the Cold War when spys infiltrated countries to steal information. As technology has advanced, we now store everything on password encrypted devices that make it much harder for anyone who wants to get in. But because of this, informaton can be cracked from a much further distance.</p>
