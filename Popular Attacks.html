                <h2>1999 NASA Cyber Attack</h2>
                <p>Known as the first young hacker, c0mrade, a 15 year old boy hacked inot NASA and managed to shut down their networking systems for nearly 3 weeks. In this hack, he accessed emails and credientls from employees. A huge company like NASA should have the best security around, but somehow a boy infiltrated their systems. Image what someone with more experience could've done.</p>

                <h2>2009's RockYou2021</h2>
                <p>The largest password leak to date. This was now the biggest data leak and everyone had to change their password to avoid anyone from hacking into their account. This was also a global .txt file that anyone could access. What made things even worse is that most of the people used the same password for many different sites and so many people's information were stolen and used. The cyber world was in a frenzy to figure out how this could've happened. Approximately 8.4 billion entries were posted.</p>
